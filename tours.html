          Our tours are kept small so we maximize our enjoyment and minimize our impact on the environment. Prices include the use of our boats, paddles, and personal flotation devices. (You may use your own equipment if you prefer.) Our guides are naturalists
          as well as American Canoe Association certified instructors who are there to share their knowledge of the river and help you with your paddling, if needed.
